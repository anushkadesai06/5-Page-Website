	Welcome to My First HTML Web Page
	</h1>
	
	<p>
	My name is Anushka Desai and I am a Junior,  I have taken Exploring Computer Science as well as AP Computer Science here at Irvine High. Exploring Computer Science went into the basics of HTML and there was a small project which asked us to create a web page. I do not know much about web design other than that. I took this course so I can create a website for my uncles hospital in India.  I am well experienced in Java as that is the only language used in APCS smf over the summer I took a Java introductory course at IVC. I use the internet for school and personal entertainment.
